# Cross Site Scripting (XSS)


- ## What is Cross Site Scripting
    Cross site scripting is a type of attack where the attacker injects malicious scripts into a website.  
    The attack is carried out by using a web application to send malicious scripts to a different user.  
    It is very common for web application to have XSS vurnerabilities.  
    XSS uses a vurnerablity in a web application where the web applisation doesn't validate or encode a user input.  
    The user isn't able to distinguish a XSS script from a not non-malicious script, because the the origin of both   
    scripts are the same so the user assumes both are fine.
